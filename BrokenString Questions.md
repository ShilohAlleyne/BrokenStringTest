![[Number of AsiSl Breaks Plot.png]]

## 1. Which of the samples are likely to be controls or treated?

Samples 1-8 are treated and samples 9-16 are controls. This is evident by the lack of AsiSl breaks in Sample 1-8.

## 2 & 3. Are there any you are uncertain of? Can you explain the samples in the uncertain group?

Sample 9 has very low normalised number of AsiSl breaks at 0.267881. It is the only sample which contains AsiSl breaks that has a normalised number bellow 1, and suggesting they may be an error with the sample. 

## 4. What is the maximum percentage of possible AsiSI cut sites on chromosome 21 (as described in the chr21_AsiSI_sites.t2t.bed file) that is observed in a single sample?

There are 71 different AsiSl sites on chromosome 21. Sample 16 had the most AsiSl breaks with 18 giving it a percentage of 25.4.
